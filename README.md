## CSC240_Week1MsgMapping
 
In this repository, you will find an application that will take a given .txt file and print out how many words are in it.
This is made possible through an array list in the repositories "resources" file.
In order for this program to work, you must add your .txt file into the main project directory.
Click and drag your .txt file into the "CSC240_Week1MsgMapping" folder,
sit back, and hopefully see the project work! :D
